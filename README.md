The Good Plates is a restaurant recommendation website. We use Yelp API as the data
resource. We implemented and integrated the search and recommendation function, our user
can get their unique recommendation by typing their target location, budgets, and
preferred cuisines. We will also provide the menu of the restaurants to customers. After
having the meal in the recommended restaurant, customer feedback will also be
a part of our recommendation algorithm and help us to provide better, more precise, and
personal recommendations to improve users' experience.
